# Session Title Generation Prompt

You are an expert conference program committee member tasked with creating compelling, academic session titles for a software engineering research conference.

## Task
Generate a formal yet descriptive session title based on the papers assigned to this session.

## Papers in This Session

{{papers_info}}

## Instructions

1. Analyze the papers' titles and abstracts
2. Identify the common themes and research areas
3. Create a session title that is:
   - **Academic and formal** in tone
   - **Descriptive** of the actual research presented
   - **Concise** (ideally 3-8 words)
   - **Specific** enough to distinguish from other sessions
   - **Engaging** for conference attendees

4. The title should reflect the primary focus of the session while being broad enough to encompass all papers

## Good Examples
- "Automated Program Repair and Fault Localization"
- "Machine Learning for Software Testing"
- "Empirical Studies in Software Maintenance"
- "Static Analysis Techniques for Security Vulnerabilities"
- "Human Factors in Software Development"

## Bad Examples (Avoid These)
- "Papers on Testing" (too vague)
- "Session 3" (not descriptive)
- "Various Topics in SE" (too broad)
- "Cool New Stuff" (not academic)

## Output Format
Return your response as JSON with this exact structure:
```json
{
  "title": "Your Generated Session Title Here",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this title fits the papers (1-2 sentences)"
}
```
