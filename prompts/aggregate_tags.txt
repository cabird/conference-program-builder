You are analyzing multiple sets of research theme tags that were generated from different batches of papers from a software engineering conference.

Each batch independently identified research themes with descriptions and estimated paper counts.

Your task is to:
1. Identify similar or overlapping tags across batches and merge them
2. Create unified descriptions that capture the essence of merged tags
3. Sum the estimated counts for merged tags
4. Select the top {{num_tags}} most representative tags based on:
   - Frequency across batches (tags that appeared in multiple batches are important)
   - Total estimated paper count
   - Breadth of coverage across different research areas

Return a JSON object with a "tags" array containing exactly {{num_tags}} tags. Each tag should have:
- "name": the tag name (use the clearest, most representative name from the batches)
- "description": a comprehensive one-sentence description
- "estimated_count": sum of counts from all similar tags across batches

Example format:
{
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "AI-assisted development",
      "description": "Use of AI or machine learning to support or automate aspects of software engineering.",
      "estimated_count": 42
    },
    {
      "name": "Software testing",
      "description": "Techniques and automation for verifying and validating software quality.",
      "estimated_count": 35
    }
  ]
}
