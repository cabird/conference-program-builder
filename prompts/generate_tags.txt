You are analyzing research papers from a software engineering conference.
You will be provided with paper titles, abstracts, and existing topic keywords.

Based on this content, identify the top {{num_tags}} most representative research areas or themes
that would be useful for organizing papers into conference sessions.

Consider:
- Common research problems addressed
- Technical approaches and methodologies
- Application domains
- Software engineering subdisciplines

For each tag:
1. Provide a clear, concise name (IMPORTANT: Use 3-5 words maximum for the tag name, preferably 3 words)
2. Write a one-sentence description explaining the scope of this research area
3. Estimate approximately how many papers (out of {{total_papers}} total) would fit into that category

Return a JSON object with a "tags" array. Each tag should be an object with:
- "name": the tag name
- "description": one-sentence description of what this tag covers
- "estimated_count": approximate number of papers that would fit this category

Example format:
{
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "AI-assisted development",
      "description": "Use of AI or machine learning to support or automate aspects of software engineering.",
      "estimated_count": 15
    },
    {
      "name": "Code review",
      "description": "Processes, tools, and practices for reviewing source code collaboratively.",
      "estimated_count": 8
    },
    {
      "name": "Software testing",
      "description": "Techniques and automation for verifying and validating software quality.",
      "estimated_count": 12
    }
  ]
}
